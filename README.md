Vagrant Ubuntu Image
====================

My main dev machines are Windows, so I run into situations where I need a Linux box for dev, testing, messing around, or because Cygwin just doesn't cut it sometimes. This Vagrant box loads all my favorite configs and software so I can get a clean, yet configured VM quickly.

Settings
--------

An example settings file is located at `vagrant.yml.example`. Rename if to `vagrant.yml` and replace the config items with your own.
